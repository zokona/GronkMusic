You can use this however you want but DO NOT SELL IT.

You need a Youtube API key, Discord bot token, and the latest Python installed.

Then you can run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all of the needed packages.

Create a "secrets.env" file in the same folder as main.py and put in
```
TOKEN=PUT BOT TOKEN HERE
YT_KEY=PUT YOUTUBE API KEY HERE
```

Then just run main.py and everything should work!
